<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Vishal Sharma and I am a recent graduate 
  from University of New England with a Bachelors in 
  Data Science and a minor in Business Administration. 
  I grew up in a small town called Saco. I currently 
  work as a Retail Sales Manager at an AT&T store. 
  I have always had a passion for technology and 
  problem solving, which is what led me to pursue a Masters
  in Data Analytics at Boston University while also 
  learning web development on the side. In my free time, 
  I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and 
  spending time with my friends and family.
